       "   'comments': 'Greta was a lovely host! She was communicative, helpful and flexible during the booking process and very responsive and friendly when we were at her place in NYC. The house is charming and comfortable, and very conveniently located right by the 1 train. We were two of us and only used one room, but the house can fit another person or two. \\r\\nFor anyone visiting NYC and looking to be in the city but not in the midst of the city noise, this is a great place to stay! You can be downtown in 20 minutes. '},\n",

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!\"},\n",

She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",
